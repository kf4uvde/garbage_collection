This project is part of a course titled "System C Project - Write a Garbage Collector"
The purpose of this course is to complete a library similar to garbage collection and discuss the reasons behind the absence of garbage collection in the C programming language.
I have implemented all the features in this project. This initiative addresses critical memory management challenges in C/C++ programming, providing a robust solution to detect and manage memory leaks.
